PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
================================================================================
Penn State, University Park, PA                                       2012.8-now
Research Assitant, Advisor: Trent Jaeger
  BinTran: a static binary rewriting tool that can arbitrarily insert or modify
  instructions within an ELF object, based on which, we instrumented the
  MINIX microkernel to implement the fine-grained control-flow integrity.
  [https://github.com/aegiryy/bintran]

  SPROBES: a TrustZone-based instrumentation mechanism that can transparently
  break on any normal world instruction from the secure world, using which, we
  enforced the kernel code integrity for Linux.

  STING+: an in-vivo dynamic testing framework that can intercept all ongoing
  system calls with the capability to modify their arguments and return values
  at runtime, based on which, we developed a system to detect unsafe resource
  access in various programs (e.g., Apache).

Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA                                    2015.5-2015.8
Research Intern, Mentor: Weidong Cui
  Developed a prototype system for supporting Intel Processor Trace on Windows,
  enabling efficiently tracing multithreaded applications and recovering the
  exact control flows afterwards.

Microsoft Research, Redmond, WA                                    2014.5-2014.8
Research Intern, Mentor: David Molnar
  Developed an Azure cloud testing service that runs SAGE, a whitebox fuzzer
  employing symbolic execution to find defects as fast as possible by maximizing
  the code coverage, for resource-efficient large-scale fuzz testing of Windows
  applications (e.g., Microsoft Office).

eBay Inc., Shanghai, China                                         2011.8-2012.5
Technical Intern, Mentor: Eddy Cai
  Developed a specialized search engine for historical SQL queries to help new
  database administrators find reusable queries.

Nanjing University, Nanjing, China                                 2011.3-2011.6
Teaching Assistant, Class: Operating System Principles
                    Instructor: Jidong Ge
  fryy: a small operating system kernel designed from scratch for illustrating
  how OS functions (e.g., task management, file system, etc.) are implemented on
  real hardwares (x86).
  [https://github.com/aegiryy/fryy]

State Key Laboratory for Novel Software Technology, Nanjing, China 2010.3-2011.2
Research Assistant, Advisor: Zhenyu Chen
  Implemented an experimental recommender system and proposed a prediction
  approach based on regression for improving the quality of recommendation.
